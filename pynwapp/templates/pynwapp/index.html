<h2>What is Python?</h2>
<p class="with-left-img">
   <img src="{% static 'pynwapp/images/python.png' %}" alt="Python logo" />
   Python is the name of a computer programming language created by Guido van Rossum
   in 1991. Today, Python's friendly syntax and pragmatic &quot;batteries-included&quot; 
   standard library make it a popular choice for web applications, data science, and in
   the classroom.</p>

<h2>Talks and Workshops</h2>
<p>We host talks on a wide variety of Python-related topics. If there is a subject in particular
   you would like to hear about, or if you would like to present a talk at one of our sessions, 
   please <a href="https://twitter.com/pythonnw">contact us via Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>We also run workshops from time to time, where folks can come along and get hands-on with some 
   Python code. We recommend bringing along a laptop if you have one, and 
   <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">installing Python</a> beforehand 
   to get up and running smoothly. But if not, don't worry as there will be somebody there to pair up
   with and/or lend a hand.</p>
